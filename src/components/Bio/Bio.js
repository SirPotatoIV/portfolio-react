        As a former medical device engineer and project manager, I learned the
        skills of design verification, risk management, documentation, and team
        collaboration. I hold a Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Engineering
        from the Illinois Institute of Technology and am currently completing a
        certification in Full Stack Web Development from the University of
        Minnesota. I strive to make the userâ€™s experience accessible, intuitive,
        fun, and aesthetically pleasing.
